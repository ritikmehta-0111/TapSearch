# TapSearch

This application tapsearch takes input as text(paragraph format and each paragraph is separated by 2 new lines). 
I have created this project using python and created API of this project using flask module which has three function named like, 
-->index for indexing paragraph and gives output like "Index created".
-->search for query which user has supposed to enter and gives output like "word found in paragraph 1 and 2" and if word is not found then gives like "word not found".
-->clear for clear the reversed indexed dictionary and gives output like "Index deleted"
But I am facing problem while deploying on Heroku. So I am not able to make frontend for this application.
I have tested it on postman software and also attached screenshots with the mail.
